# Hypixel Event Websocket

Websocket Server broadcasting simple hypixel events e.g. death/kill/win/loss in a gamemode or on the network (for a specific player)

This only sends Events once a game ended!

Now, put the UUID of the Player you want to track and your [API Key](https://api.hypixel.net/#section/Authentication) in the config.json
Then just run ```node index.js``` and the server will be running.
